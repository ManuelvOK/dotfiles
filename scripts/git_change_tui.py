"""Terminal user interface of git change, for the reviewer.

Started by `git change` without arguments. Two screens: the stacks in
review (one per review branch), and one change with its files, its comment
threads and the diff, which shows the threads under their lines.
Keys are shown at the bottom of every screen, `?` lists them all.

The change screen shows the diff as delta renders it (side by side). t hands
over to vimdiff. Comments are written in a small box that opens inside the
diff and pushes the lines below down, ^E continues in the reviewer's
editor. The screen reloads by itself when commits or notes change, e.g.
when the author answers.

The mouse works too: a click selects, a double click opens, the wheel
scrolls.
